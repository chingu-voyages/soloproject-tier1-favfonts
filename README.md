**Chingu Pre-Work Solo Project - Tier 1 - Favorite Fonts**

The goal of this project is to allow you to show your skillset in HTML / CSS / JavaScript. Use of frameworks or libraries is not permitted in this project, and none were used in the coding of the example project.

This project was designed with growth in mind! For tier 1, you will implement a great looking UI closely related to the Google Fonts landing page. There have been some stylistic changes. Once you're done with the layout, you are more than welcome to come back to the project and work on the tier 2 and tier 3 features, which see the static page becoming completely responsive and dynamic through use of the Google Fonts API, then user-friendly with authentication and back-end persistence.

**Requirements**
*1.* Implement the design of each element included in the page. You should have an header with minor navigation, a main with major navigation, a section for displaying each font card, and a footer with your information in it.

*2.* In the major navigation, you are only required to make the custom text area and the reset button functional; however, other parts of the navigation should be visible and appear functional.

**Extra Features (Not Required)**\
*1.* Implement the dark/light and grid/list toggle views.

*2.* Make your design fully responsive

*3.* Add and implement a back to top button

**Things to Keep In Mind**
All of the font information will be hardcoded for this tier. You can import the fonts by going to the Google Fonts page.

Ask questions! Whether it be through Google searches or the Discord channels, the best way to get unstuck is to search and ask.

Using the your dev tools on the example is not a great way to learn, so resist it as much as possible. Spend time visually analyzing the design first. If you need to, do some wireframing or notetaking to organize your design BEFORE you code it. This WILL help you!
